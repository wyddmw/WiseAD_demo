The emergence of general human knowledge and impressive logical reasoning capacity in rapidly progressed visionlanguage models (VLMs) have driven increasing interest in applying VLMs to high-level autonomous driving tasks, such as scene understanding and decision-making. However, an in-depth study on the relationship between knowledge proficiency—especially essential driving expertise—and closedloop autonomous driving performance requires further exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the depth and breadth of fundamental driving knowledge on closed-loop trajectory planning and introduce WiseAD, a specialized VLM tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving capable of driving reasoning, action justification, object recognition, risk analysis, driving suggestions, and trajectory planning across diverse scenarios. We employ joint training on driving knowledge and planning datasets, enabling the model to perform knowledge-aligned trajectory
planning accordingly. Extensive experiments indicate that as the diversity of driving knowledge extends, critical accidents
are notably reduced, contributing 11.9% and 12.4% improvements in the driving score and route completion on the Carla
closed-loop evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, WiseAD also demonstrates remarkable
performance in knowledge evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

## ✨Functions

An overview of the function of our proposed WiseAD, a specialized vision-language model for end-to-end autonomous driving with extensive
fundamental driving knowledge. Given a clip of the video sequence, our WiseAD is capable of answering various driving-related questions
and performing knowledge-augmented trajectory planning according to the target waypoints.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
